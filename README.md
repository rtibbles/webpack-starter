This is a starter for Webpack.

Here is a basic bootstrapped Webpack Project.

After you have cloned the initial project, add some CSS to your project:

Setup webpack to use Typescript (or try another JS flavour, like JSX using Babel):

https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/#basic-setup

Finally, let's get the build ready for production, and add minification to our build:
